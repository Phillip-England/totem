# Department Map
In this application, we import data from HotSchedules. In HotSchedules, we can assign job codes to our employees. Here is how those job codes map into our system. Keep in mind they are mapped by precedence, meaning higher Departments will take priority if multiple are present.

PARTNER="Dispatcher"
EXECUTIVE="Mobile Drinks"
CENTRAL="Lemons"
DIRECTOR="Front Counter Stager"
BOH="BOH General"
FOH="FOH General"
NONE"-"

This allows us to know how to import data from the HotSchedules system.
